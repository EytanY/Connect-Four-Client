# Connect Four Game
Welcome to the Connect Four game! 
This project consists of a client-side and a server-side implementation, allowing players to engage in exciting matches against the server. 
This README file will guide you through the setup, rules, and usage of the game.

# Rules
Connect Four is a two-player game played on a grid of six rows and seven columns. 
The goal is to be the first player to connect four of their colored discs in a row, column, or diagonal.

Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs into a chosen column.
The disc will fall to the lowest available spot in the column.
The game ends when either player successfully connects four discs or when the game board is full.
If the game board is full and no player has won, the game is considered a draw.
